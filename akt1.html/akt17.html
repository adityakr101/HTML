                Income, expenses, and profit are financial terms that are used to measure the financial health of a person or a business.
            </p>
            <p class="income">
                Income refers to the amount of money received by an individual or business from various sources such as employment, investments, or sales of goods and services. Income can be earned on a regular basis, such as a salary, or irregularly, such as a bonus or one-time payment.
            </p>
            <p class="expenses">
                Expenses, on the other hand, refer to the amount of money spent by an individual or business to cover their costs of living or operating. Expenses can include fixed costs such as rent or salaries, variable costs such as the cost of materials, or discretionary costs such as entertainment or travel.
            </p>
            <p class="profit">
                Profit is the amount of money that remains after deducting expenses from income. It represents the financial gain or loss that a person or business has generated over a given period of time. A positive profit means that the income was greater than the expenses, while a negative profit means that the expenses were greater than the income.
